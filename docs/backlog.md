plotly
dash
SQLAlchemy
Flask
gunicorn
pytest

## TaskList

- ['data_ingestion.py', 'Implements the DataIngestion class to read data from ~/Desktop/solar_sensors.csv and load it into a pandas DataFrame. This class will handle data ingestion and ensure new data is ingested as it becomes available.']
- ['data_curation.py', 'Implements the DataCuration class to perform initial data quality checks, such as verifying the absence of duplicate records and ensuring data types are consistent with the data model.']
- ['data_transformation.py', 'Implements the DataTransformation class to apply business logic to calculate KPIs such as current energy output, underperformance metrics, and failure rates, and to populate the FACT_SOLAR_OUTPUT, DIM_WEATHER, and DIM_PANEL_STATE tables.']
- ['predictive_model.py', 'Implements the PredictiveModel class to develop a machine learning model to forecast potential solar panel failures using historical data, feature engineering, and an appropriate machine learning algorithm.']
- ['data_visualization.py', 'Implements the DataVisualization class to create interactive visualizations using plotly and dash, including time series graphs, performance heatmaps, bar charts, and predictive model outputs.']
- ['orchestration.py', 'Implements the Orchestration class to coordinate the execution of the microservices, handling any dependencies and ensuring data integrity throughout the pipeline.']
- ['dashboard_app.py', 'Sets up the Dash application, integrating all visualizations into the BI Dashboard and ensuring real-time and historical insights into solar panel performance are displayed.']
