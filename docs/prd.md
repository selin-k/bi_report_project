# Requirements Document for Interactive BI Dashboard for Solar Panel Data Analysis

## Purpose

The purpose of this document is to outline the requirements for the development of an interactive Business Intelligence (BI) dashboard that will enable the monitoring and analysis of solar panel performance, identify underperforming panels, and analyze failure rates and reasons.

## Assumptions

- The solar panel data is accurate and reflects real-time measurements.
- The data update frequency is sufficient for real-time analysis.
- Users of the dashboard will have basic knowledge of solar panel metrics.

## FunctionalRequirements

- The dashboard should display the current energy output of solar panels.
- The dashboard should identify and flag underperforming solar panels.
- The dashboard should provide insights into the reasons for solar panel failures and their frequency.
- The dashboard should allow users to filter data by date, weather conditions, and other relevant parameters.

## NonFunctionalRequirements

- The dashboard should be accessible via web browsers on both desktop and mobile devices.
- The dashboard should refresh data in real-time or near-real-time.
- The dashboard should maintain high performance and responsiveness even with large datasets.

## DataSources

- Solar sensor data will be sourced from the CSV file located at /Users/selinkayay/appgenpro/data/solar_sensors.csv.

## DataCuration

- Data will be validated to ensure there are no missing or corrupt values.
- Data normalization techniques will be applied to ensure consistency across different solar panels and conditions.

## DataTransformation

- The following KPIs will be defined: Total Energy Output, Panel Efficiency, Failure Rate, and Correlation with Environmental Factors.
- KPIs will be calculated using specific business logic based on the data provided.

## DataVisualization

- Time series graphs for energy output over time.
- Heatmaps or color-coded tables for panel performance.
- Pie charts or bar graphs for the distribution of panel states.
- Scatter plots or correlation matrices for environmental factors versus panel performance.

## DataSecurityAndPrivacy

- All data will be handled in compliance with relevant data protection regulations.
- Sensitive data will be anonymized or encrypted as necessary.

## Orchestration

- Data processing and visualization updates will be orchestrated to ensure timely data refreshes.

## UIRequirements

- The dashboard will be user-friendly with an intuitive interface.
- Users will be able to interact with the visualizations to drill down into specific data points.

## UserStories

- As a maintenance manager, I want to quickly identify underperforming solar panels so that I can schedule maintenance activities efficiently.
- As an operations analyst, I want to monitor the current energy output to optimize the performance of the solar panel array.
- As a data scientist, I want to analyze the correlation between environmental factors and panel performance to improve energy output predictions.

## AnythingUnclear

The requirements have been clearly defined and understood.
