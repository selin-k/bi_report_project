# Business Intelligence Dashboard for Solar Panel Performance Monitoring

## Purpose

The purpose of this document is to outline the requirements for the development of an interactive Business Intelligence (BI) Dashboard that will enable users to monitor and analyze the performance of solar panels.

## Assumptions

- The application will be developed to support daily data processing.
- Users of the dashboard will have general business knowledge without requiring technical expertise in data analysis.

## FunctionalRequirements

- The application should allow users to view the current energy output of solar panels.
- The application should identify and report underperforming solar panels based on predefined performance thresholds.
- The application should analyze and report on the causes and frequency of solar panel failures.
- The application should provide predictive insights on potential solar panel failures.

## NonFunctionalRequirements

- The dashboard should adhere to the IEC61970 standard for the Energy Industry.
- The dashboard should be capable of handling CSV data formats.
- The dashboard should be designed for daily data updates.

## DataSources

- Solar sensor data will be sourced from a CSV file located at /project_name/data/solar_sensors.csv.

## DataCuration

- Missing values will be handled by appropriate imputation methods.
- Data normalization techniques will be applied where necessary to ensure consistency.

## DataTransformation

- KPIs will be defined based on industry standards and client input.
- Metrics logic will be developed to calculate energy output, efficiency, and other relevant performance indicators.

## DataVisualization

- The dashboard will display daily, weekly, and monthly electricity production trends.
- The dashboard will show variations in production or capacity with changing weather or temperature.
- The dashboard will compare different panels' performance and show capacity utilization.
- The dashboard will correlate factors like temperature or sunlight intensity with panel efficiency.
- The dashboard will display key performance indicators such as average daily production, total capacity, and efficiency metrics.
- The dashboard will include interactive features such as drill-down capabilities and hover-over details.

## DataSecurityAndPrivacy

- All data will be handled in compliance with organizational standards and privacy regulations.

## Orchestration

- The application will be orchestrated to ensure data is processed and visualized in a timely manner.

## UIRequirements

- The application will be accessible via a web interface.
- The UI will allow users to select specific time periods, panels, or metrics for analysis.
- The UI will include global filters for time periods, geographic locations, and panel types.

## UserStories

- As a business user, I want to view the current energy output to assess real-time performance.
- As a maintenance manager, I want to identify underperforming solar panels to schedule maintenance or replacement.
- As an operations analyst, I want to understand the causes and frequency of panel failures to improve reliability.

## AnythingUnclear

The requirements have been clearly defined and understood.
