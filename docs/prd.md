# Solar Panel Performance BI Dashboard Requirements Document

## Purpose

The purpose of this document is to outline the requirements for the development of an interactive Business Intelligence (BI) Dashboard that will enable the client to monitor and analyze the performance of solar panels.

## Assumptions

- The client has provided a dataset located at /Users/selinkayay/appgenpro/data/solar_sensors.csv which contains all the necessary data for the dashboard.
- The client expects to see real-time data on the dashboard; hence, the data source will be updated regularly.

## FunctionalRequirements

- The dashboard should display the current energy output of the solar panels.
- The dashboard should identify and highlight underperforming solar panels and provide reasons for underperformance.
- The dashboard should report on the frequency and reasons for solar panel failures.

## NonFunctionalRequirements

- The dashboard should be accessible via web browsers on both desktop and mobile devices.
- The dashboard should have an interactive user interface allowing users to filter and drill down into specific data points.
- The dashboard should refresh data in real-time or near real-time to reflect the most current status of the solar panels.

## DataSources

- The primary data source will be the solar_sensors.csv file provided by the client, which will be ingested into the BI tool.

## DataCuration

- The dataset is confirmed to have no missing values; therefore, no imputation is necessary.
- Data normalization will not be required as the data types are appropriate and consistent.

## DataTransformation

- Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) such as 'Total Energy Output', 'Panel Efficiency', and 'Failure Rate' will be defined and calculated using the provided dataset.

## DataVisualization

- Visualizations will include time-series graphs for energy output, heat maps for panel performance, and bar charts for failure rates.
- Interactive elements will allow users to select specific time frames, weather conditions, or other parameters to view detailed performance data.

## DataSecurityAndPrivacy

- All data will be handled in compliance with relevant data protection regulations.
- User access to the dashboard will be controlled through authentication and authorization mechanisms.

## Orchestration

- Data updates will be automated to ensure the dashboard reflects the latest information without manual intervention.

## UIRequirements

- The dashboard will be designed with a user-friendly interface, incorporating clear labels, legends, and tooltips to assist users in interpreting the data.
- The UI will provide export functionality for reports in formats such as CSV, PDF, or Excel.

## UserStories

- As a solar farm operator, I want to see the current energy output so that I can assess the productivity of my solar panels in real-time.
- As a maintenance engineer, I want to identify underperforming solar panels and understand their reasons for underperformance to prioritize maintenance activities.
- As a manager, I want to analyze the failure rates and patterns of solar panels to improve future panel designs and preventive maintenance schedules.

## AnythingUnclear

The requirements have been clearly defined based on the client's request and the data analysis provided.
