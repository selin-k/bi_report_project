# Business Intelligence Dashboard for Solar Panel Performance Monitoring

## Purpose

The purpose of this document is to outline the requirements for the development of an interactive Business Intelligence (BI) Dashboard that will enable users to monitor and analyze the performance of solar panels.

## Assumptions

- The application will be developed to support daily data processing.
- Users of the dashboard will have general business knowledge without requiring technical expertise in data analysis.

## FunctionalRequirements

- The application should provide real-time monitoring of current energy output.
- The application should identify underperforming solar panels and provide insights into potential causes.
- The application should predict potential solar panel failures and their frequency.

## NonFunctionalRequirements

- The dashboard will adhere to the IEC61970 standard for the Energy Industry.
- The dashboard will be designed for use by general business users, ensuring ease of use and accessibility.
- The dashboard will be capable of handling CSV data formats and ensure data integrity during processing.

## DataSources

- Solar sensor data will be sourced from a CSV file located at /project_name/data/solar_sensors.csv.

## DataCuration

- Missing values will be handled by appropriate imputation methods to maintain data quality.
- Data normalization techniques will be applied where necessary to ensure consistency in analysis.

## DataTransformation

- KPIs will be defined based on industry standards and client input, including average daily production, total capacity, and efficiency metrics.
- Metrics logic will be developed to calculate performance based on the provided solar sensor data fields.

## DataVisualization

- The dashboard will display daily, weekly, and monthly electricity production trends.
- The dashboard will include visualizations that show production variations with changing weather or temperature.
- The dashboard will allow comparison of different panels' performance and show capacity utilization.
- The dashboard will correlate factors like temperature or sunlight intensity with panel efficiency.
- The dashboard will include interactive features such as drill-down capabilities and hover-over details.

## DataSecurityAndPrivacy

- All sensitive data will be handled in compliance with relevant data protection regulations.
- Data will be stored securely with encryption and access controls in place.

## Orchestration

- The application will be orchestrated to ensure daily data processing and updating of the dashboard.

## UIRequirements

- The application will be accessible via a web interface.
- The UI will allow users to select specific time periods, panels, or metrics for analysis.
- The UI will provide global filters for time periods, geographic locations, and panel types.

## UserStories

- As a business user, I want to view the current energy output so that I can monitor the real-time performance of solar panels.
- As a maintenance manager, I want to identify underperforming solar panels and understand why they are not performing well to schedule maintenance or replacements.
- As an operations analyst, I want to predict when solar panels might fail so that I can proactively manage panel maintenance and reduce downtime.

## AnythingUnclear

Everything is clear.
