# Requirements Document for Interactive BI Dashboard for Solar Panel Data Analysis

## Purpose

The purpose of this document is to outline the requirements for an interactive Business Intelligence (BI) dashboard that will enable the client to monitor current energy output, identify underperforming solar panels, and analyze panel failures and their frequency.

## Assumptions

- The data provided in the CSV file represents the 'current' state of the solar panels.
- The 'State' column in the CSV file indicates the operational status of the solar panels, which can be used to determine failures.

## FunctionalRequirements

- The dashboard should display the current energy output of the solar panels.
- The dashboard should allow users to identify underperforming solar panels by comparing individual outputs to the average output.
- The dashboard should provide insights into the frequency and reasons for solar panel failures.
- The dashboard should be interactive, allowing users to drill down into specific data points for detailed analysis.

## NonFunctionalRequirements

- The dashboard should be web-based and accessible through modern web browsers.
- The dashboard should be responsive and work on various devices including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.
- The dashboard should perform efficiently with minimal load times.

## DataSources

- Solar panel sensor data will be sourced from the provided CSV file located at /Users/selinkayay/appgenpro/data/solar_sensors.csv.

## DataCuration

- Missing values will be identified and handled appropriately, either by imputation or exclusion, based on the nature of the data.
- Data validation checks will be implemented to ensure accuracy and consistency.

## DataTransformation

- KPIs for average energy output, performance comparison, and failure rates will be defined and calculated.
- Data will be aggregated and summarized as needed to support dashboard visualizations.

## DataVisualization

- Real-time visualization of current energy output.
- Comparative visualizations to highlight underperforming solar panels.
- Visualizations to represent the frequency and patterns of panel failures.

## DataSecurityAndPrivacy

- All data will be handled in compliance with relevant data protection regulations.
- User access to the dashboard will be controlled through authentication and authorization mechanisms.

## Orchestration

- The dashboard will be updated at regular intervals to reflect the most recent data.
- Automated data pipelines will be established for data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL).

## UIRequirements

- The dashboard will have an intuitive and user-friendly interface.
- The UI will include interactive elements such as filters, dropdowns, and drill-down capabilities.

## UserStories

- As a solar farm operator, I want to see the current energy output so that I can assess the productivity of my solar panels.
- As a maintenance manager, I want to identify underperforming solar panels to determine if they require maintenance or replacement.
- As a data analyst, I want to analyze the reasons for panel failures to improve the reliability and efficiency of the solar panel array.
