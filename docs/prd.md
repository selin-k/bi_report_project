# Solar Panel Sensor Data BI Dashboard Requirements Document

## Purpose

The purpose of this document is to outline the requirements for the development of an interactive Business Intelligence (BI) Dashboard that will enable the monitoring, analysis, and prediction of solar panel performance.

## Assumptions

- The client requires a dashboard that can display real-time data and historical analysis.
- The client expects the dashboard to have predictive capabilities to forecast potential solar panel failures.
- The client prefers that we select the most suitable predictive model based on the data characteristics.

## FunctionalRequirements

- The dashboard should display the current energy output of solar panels.
- The dashboard should identify underperforming solar panels and provide insights into potential causes.
- The dashboard should analyze failure rates and patterns of the solar panels.
- The dashboard should predict future failures of solar panels using a suitable machine learning model.

## NonFunctionalRequirements

- The dashboard should be accessible via web browsers on both desktop and mobile devices.
- The dashboard should ensure data security and comply with relevant data protection regulations.
- The dashboard should perform efficiently with minimal latency.
- The dashboard should be scalable to accommodate additional solar panel data sources in the future.

## DataSources

- Solar panel sensor data will be sourced from a CSV file located at ~/Desktop/solar_sensors.csv.

## DataCuration

- The dataset is confirmed to have no missing values; hence no imputation is required.
- Data normalization techniques will be applied to ensure consistency across different scales.

## DataTransformation

- KPIs such as current energy output, underperformance metrics, and failure rates will be defined and calculated using specific business logic.

## DataScience

- A predictive model will be developed to forecast potential failures based on historical data.
- Feature engineering will be performed to enhance model accuracy.

## DataVisualization

- Time series graphs will be used for visualizing energy output over time.
- Heatmaps or bar charts will be used to identify and compare the performance of solar panels.
- Charts showing the frequency and conditions of panel failures will be included.
- A section displaying the predicted likelihood of future panel failures will be integrated.

## DataSecurityAndPrivacy

- All sensitive data will be handled in compliance with industry-standard data protection regulations.
- Data will be stored securely with encryption at rest and in transit.

## Orchestration

- The dashboard will be orchestrated using a modern web application framework.

## UIRequirements

- The dashboard will be accessible using standard web browsers.
- The UI will have interactive filters for date range, weather conditions, and operational states.
- The UI will provide drill-down capabilities for detailed analysis.
- The UI will include alerts/notifications for real-time monitoring based on predefined thresholds.

## UserStories

- As a maintenance manager, I want to view the current energy output of solar panels so that I can assess their performance in real-time.
- As a technician, I want to identify underperforming solar panels and understand the reasons behind their underperformance to take corrective actions.
- As an operations analyst, I want to analyze the failure rates and patterns of solar panels to improve maintenance schedules.
- As a risk manager, I want to predict when solar panels are likely to fail in the coming months to proactively manage replacement or repair.

## AnythingUnclear

The requirements have been clearly defined and are ready for the next phase of development.
