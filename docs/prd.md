# Requirements Document for Interactive BI Dashboard for Solar Panel Data

## Purpose

The purpose of this document is to outline the requirements for the development of an interactive Business Intelligence (BI) Dashboard that will enable the client to monitor and analyze the performance of solar panels.

## Assumptions

- The client has provided a dataset located at /Users/selinkayay/appgenpro/data/solar_sensors.csv which contains the necessary data for analysis.
- The client requires the dashboard to be interactive and user-friendly to facilitate easy access to real-time data and insights.

## FunctionalRequirements

- The dashboard should display the current total energy output of the solar panels.
- The dashboard should identify and highlight underperforming solar panels and provide insights into potential causes.
- The dashboard should show the frequency and types of failures ('Open' and 'Line-line') and allow for a deeper analysis of the reasons behind these failures.

## NonFunctionalRequirements

- The dashboard should be developed using a BI tool such as Tableau or Power BI to ensure interactivity and real-time data visualization.
- The dashboard should be designed with scalability in mind to accommodate additional data sources or metrics in the future.
- The dashboard should be accessible on multiple devices, including desktops and tablets, to ensure it is available to users in different environments.

## DataSources

- The primary data source will be the solar_sensors.csv file provided by the client, which contains historical data on solar panel performance.

## DataCuration

- Missing values will be handled by imputation or exclusion based on the context and impact on the analysis.
- Data normalization techniques will be applied where necessary to ensure consistency and accuracy in reporting.

## DataTransformation

- KPIs such as total energy output, performance metrics, and failure rates will be defined and calculated using specific business logic.

## DataVisualization

- Visualizations will include time series graphs for energy output, heat maps for panel performance, and bar charts for failure types and frequencies.

## DataSecurityAndPrivacy

- All data will be handled in compliance with relevant data protection regulations to ensure the privacy and security of the information.
- Access to the dashboard will be controlled through authentication and authorization mechanisms.

## Orchestration

- The dashboard will be updated in real-time or at a minimum, on a daily basis, to reflect the most current data available.

## UIRequirements

- The dashboard will be designed with a user-friendly interface that allows users to interact with the visualizations and filter data as needed.
- The UI will include tooltips and help sections to guide users on how to interpret the data and use the dashboard effectively.

## UserStories

- As a maintenance manager, I want to quickly identify underperforming solar panels so that I can schedule maintenance or replacements to optimize energy output.
- As an operations analyst, I want to analyze the frequency and types of panel failures to develop strategies for reducing downtime and improving panel reliability.

## AnythingUnclear

The requirements have been clearly defined based on the client's request and the data analysis provided.
