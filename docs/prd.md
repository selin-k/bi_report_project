# Solar Panel KPIs BI Report Requirements Document

## Purpose

The purpose of this document is to outline the requirements for a Business Intelligence (BI) application that will display key performance indicators (KPIs) for solar panel production and capacity based on solar sensor data.

## Assumptions

- The BI application will be used by the solar panel manufacturing team to monitor and improve production processes.
- Users of the BI application will have a basic understanding of data analysis and KPI interpretation.

## FunctionalRequirements

- The application should provide real-time access to solar panel production data.
- The application should allow users to filter KPIs by date range, production line, and solar panel type.
- The application should enable comparison of actual production data against production targets.

## NonFunctionalRequirements

- The BI application should be web-based with responsive design for accessibility on multiple devices.
- The application should ensure high availability and minimal downtime.
- The application should perform with low latency to ensure quick loading of reports.

## DataSources

- Solar sensor data will be accessed from the in-house IoT platform.
- Production data will be accessed from the manufacturing execution system (MES).
- Historical performance data will be accessed from the enterprise data warehouse.

## DataCuration

- Missing values will be handled by imputation or exclusion based on the context.
- Data normalization techniques will be applied where necessary to ensure consistency.

## DataTransformation

- KPIs such as production efficiency, defect rate, and capacity utilization will be defined and calculated using specific business logic.
- Data will be aggregated and summarized to support KPI tracking at various hierarchical levels (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly).

## DataVisualization

- Interactive dashboards will be created to display KPIs in a user-friendly manner.
- Visualizations will include time series charts, bar graphs, and heat maps to represent different aspects of production performance.

## DataSecurityAndPrivacy

- All sensitive data will be handled in compliance with industry standards and regulations such as GDPR.
- User access will be controlled through authentication and authorization mechanisms.

## Orchestration

- The application will be orchestrated using a cloud-based BI platform to manage data flows and report generation.

## UIRequirements

- The application will be accessed through a web browser with no additional software installation required.
- The UI will provide intuitive navigation and the ability to export reports in various formats (e.g., PDF, Excel).

## UserStories

- As a production manager, I want to view daily production KPIs so that I can quickly identify and address production issues.
- As a quality assurance engineer, I want to analyze defect rates by production line to improve the manufacturing process.
