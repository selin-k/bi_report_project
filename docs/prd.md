# Business Intelligence Dashboard for Solar Panel Performance Monitoring

## Purpose

The purpose of this document is to outline the requirements for the development of an interactive Business Intelligence (BI) Dashboard that will enable users to monitor and analyze the performance of solar panels.

## Assumptions

- The data for the dashboard will be provided in a CSV format and will be updated daily.
- The dashboard will be used by general business users with no specific color schemes or branding guidelines provided.

## FunctionalRequirements

- The dashboard must display the current energy output of solar panels.
- The dashboard must identify underperforming solar panels and provide insights into potential causes.
- The dashboard must track and analyze the frequency and reasons for solar panel failures.
- The dashboard must provide predictive insights on potential solar panel failures.

## NonFunctionalRequirements

- The dashboard must adhere to the IEC61970 standards for the Energy Industry.
- The dashboard must be capable of handling daily data updates.
- The dashboard must provide interactive features such as drill-down capabilities and hover-over details.

## DataSources

- Solar sensor data will be sourced from a CSV file located at /project_name/data/solar_sensors.csv.

## DataCuration

- Data curation will involve validating the sensor data against expected ranges and formats.
- Any missing or anomalous data will be flagged for review.

## DataTransformation

- KPIs will be defined based on industry standards and the available data fields.
- Metrics logic will be developed to calculate energy output, efficiency, and other relevant performance indicators.

## DataVisualization

- The dashboard will show daily, weekly, and monthly electricity production trends.
- The dashboard will display variations in production or capacity with changing weather or temperature.
- The dashboard will compare different panels' performance and show capacity utilization.
- The dashboard will correlate factors like temperature or sunlight intensity with panel efficiency.
- The dashboard will display key performance indicators such as average daily production, total capacity, and efficiency metrics.

## DataSecurityAndPrivacy

- All data will be handled in compliance with organizational standards and any applicable data protection regulations.

## Orchestration

- Data processing and dashboard updates will be orchestrated to occur on a daily basis.

## UIRequirements

- The dashboard will be accessible via a web interface suitable for general business users.
- The UI will allow users to select specific time periods, panels, or metrics for analysis.

## UserStories

- As a maintenance manager, I want to quickly identify underperforming solar panels so that I can schedule maintenance or replacements to optimize energy output.
- As an operations analyst, I want to analyze the correlation between weather conditions and panel performance to improve future panel designs and placements.
- As a business user, I want to view the overall energy production trends to make informed decisions about energy management and investment.
