# Business Intelligence Dashboard for Solar Panel Performance

## Purpose

The purpose of this document is to outline the requirements for the development of an interactive Business Intelligence (BI) Dashboard that will enable users to monitor, analyze, and predict solar panel performance.

## Assumptions

- The application will be used by general business users with no specialized technical knowledge.
- Users will require access to real-time and historical data regarding solar panel performance.

## FunctionalRequirements

- The application should provide real-time monitoring of current energy output.
- The application should identify underperforming solar panels and provide insights into potential causes.
- The application should include predictive analytics to forecast potential solar panel failures.
- The application should allow users to filter data by time periods, geographic locations, and panel types.

## NonFunctionalRequirements

- The dashboard will be designed with a focus on usability and clarity, adhering to best practices for dashboard aesthetics.
- The dashboard should be accessible on standard web browsers without the need for additional software installation.

## DataSources

- Solar sensor data will be loaded from a CSV file located at /project_name/data/solar_sensors.csv

## DataCuration

- Missing values will be handled by appropriate imputation methods to maintain data integrity.
- Data normalization techniques will be applied where necessary to ensure consistency.

## DataTransformation

- KPIs will be defined and calculated using specific business logic in accordance with IEC61970 standards.
- Metrics for panel efficiency, energy output, and failure rates will be developed based on the provided data fields.

## DataVisualization

- The dashboard will display daily, weekly, and monthly electricity production trends.
- It will show production or capacity variations with changing weather or temperature.
- It will compare different panels' performance and show capacity utilization.
- It will correlate factors like temperature or sunlight intensity with panel efficiency.
- It will display key performance indicators such as average daily production, total capacity, and efficiency metrics.
- It will include interactive features such as drill-down capabilities and hover-over details.

## DataSecurityAndPrivacy

- All data will be handled in compliance with relevant data protection regulations.
- User access will be controlled through authentication and authorization mechanisms.

## Orchestration

- Data processing will be scheduled on a daily basis to update the dashboard with the latest information.

## UIRequirements

- The dashboard will be designed to be intuitive for general business users.
- Interactive elements such as filters for time periods, geographic locations, and panel types will be prominently featured.

## UserStories

- As a business user, I want to view the current energy output so that I can monitor the performance of our solar panels in real-time.
- As a maintenance manager, I want to identify underperforming solar panels and understand why they are not performing well to schedule maintenance or replacements.
- As an analyst, I want to predict when a solar panel might fail so that I can proactively manage panel maintenance and reduce downtime.
